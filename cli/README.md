# CLI

This is a basic template of a CLI that you can use via `gonew`.

This project structure draws inspiration from [cli/cli](https://github.com/cli/cli)
and [kubernetes/kubectl](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubectl).
It features a streamlined setup that retains core functionalities,
while remaining easily expandable.

```bash
go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/gonew@latest
gonew github.com/ioboi/go-templates/cli github.com/ioboi/my-cli
cd my-cli
```
